We beleive that Open Source should be open to everbody, to ensure that the *\<Project\>* achives this goal we ask that contributors follow these 4 rules:

1. Comments on pull requests should be about the code not the person behind the code
2. Concider the project when expressing opinions in public places including social media
3. Harrassment, hate speach and illegal activity is not welcome, in public or in private 
4. Attempting to interfer with the complaints process is not allowed.

## Rule 1: Comments on pull requests should be about the code not the person behind the code

This is a faily simple rule, when reviewing a <insert method of code patch submission> request the review should only focus on the code produced by the author, it should not take into account the author themselves or the ammount of experince they have, this allows for new people to enter the project keeping it alive. 
  
Also when giving feedback, make it constructive and limit the use of offesnive language and restrain from personal attacks, keep it profesional. We also ask that the author of the code also follows this and takes the feedback onboard gracefully, do not assume all feedback is an attack on you.

### Scope
As this is limited to processes of the project so only covers interactions within the project

### Dicipline
After reciving a complaint we will review the review and decide if we need to talk to the reviewer, if we see the revewier is at fault we will give them a strike, after 3 strikes we will remove their reveiwing rights for a month, they will the return to the reviewing role, if they get annother 3 strikes they will be perminantly removed from the reveiwing team. Strikes reset after a clean month.

Getting removed from the reviewing team will also get a perminant strike on the main dicipine process.

## Rule 2: Concider the project when expressing opinions in public places including social media
When talking on socail media we ask that you refrain from making controversial opinions public on accounts that can be linked to the project, for example if your twitter bio says `dev of <project>` and you make a controverisal opinioun and someone complains, we concider that a valid complaint. If the account does not mention the project but we also get a complaint, we will review it and see if the complaint is valid.

### Scope
We will mainly reveiw complaints if the content in question is recent, people say stupid things some times especily when they are young and inexperinced. Private accounts will only be reviewed if we can see it.

### Dicipline
If we receive a complain about a message in a public place we will reveiw it on a case by case basis. The diciplin will start with a talking to and go to a outright ban for messages that a public, if it is on a private followers only account the highest we can do is give them a tempory strike if it does not break rule 3.


## Rule 3: Harrassment, Hate Speech and illegal activity is not welcome, in public or in private


## Rule 4: Complaints should not be discussed on public fourms without the permision on the project
